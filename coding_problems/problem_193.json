The error is caused by the fact that Counter objects are not compatible with set objects, and thus the issubset function cannot be used",
    "code": "# Create a Counter object \nfrom collections import Counter \ncounter_object = Counter({\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 3}) \n\n# Create a set object \nset_object = set([\"a\", \"b\", \"c",
